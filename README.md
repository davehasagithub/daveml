# DaveML

Possibly the dumbest project on GitHub.

Create a file `demo.txt`, such as:

```text
<BBG>|             |
<BBG>|   Welcome   |
<BBG>|             |

<GGG>This is going to be <CCC>cool
```

Run `daveml demo.txt`, and it will convert the tags to ANSI color escape codes.
Possibly useful, for example, when showing a motd (message of the day).
